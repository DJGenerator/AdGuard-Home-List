# AdGuard Home List
This is a ***VERY EARLY*** Work In Progress and ***INTENDED FOR MY PERSONAL USE!***

Use as an example on how to make your own otherwise don't complain to me that it allows too much through if you just add this to your lists. (Just because I need em doesn't mean you do!)

I'm tweaking it to allow my local servers (and smart home) to talk to google services and the alike whilst hopefully still blocking the ads, so as you can guess there are SOME services you need to let through.

***This list also allows my Honor phone to 'dial home'*** which I understand some folk believe to be controversial but the allowed Uri's are merely checking for Honor app updates.

Add the following line to AdGuard Homes "DNS Allowlists" if you really wanna use my lists. (NOT RECOMMENDED!)
