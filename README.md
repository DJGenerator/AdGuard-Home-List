# AdGuard Home List
This is a ***VERY EARLY*** Work In Progress and INTENDED FOR MY PERSONAL USE!

Use as an example on how to make your own otherwise don't complain it allows too much if you just add this to your lists.

I'm tweaking it to allow my local servers (and smart home) to talk to google services and the alike whilst hopefully still blocking the ads, so as you can guess there are SOME services you need to let through.

Add the following line to AdGuard Homes "DNS Allowlists" if you really wanna use my lists. (NOT RECOMMENDED!)

```sh

```
